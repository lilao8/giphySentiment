# Welcome to the Gif In Touch App

An emotion journal created using React and Firebase.
Entering the emotion you are feeling in the search bar will trigger an API call to the giphy api.
Select the gifs presented that most accurately represent your mood, and watch the gif get added to the timeline along with today's date.
gifs are stored in a firebase database, with functionality in app to remove and add gifs as user sees fit.
Enjoy :)
